/**
 * This file represents the template for building out vanilla javascript functionality. Simply
 * copy this file and rename to whatever the module is named. Later it will be compiled
 * into the core javascript file and new components do not need to be added to the .info file.
 * ES6 syntax is available via the Babel transpiler, so feel free to use modern syntax
 * and features.
 *
 * Each "component" should live in its own file. This allows for separation of concerns and
 * ease of locating functionality, and is just generally good practice.
 *
 * This file will be all commented out so as not to tarnish the compiled javascript with
 * example or template code.
 *
 * Each file should begin with a header stub, just like this one, with a short description
 * of the component and an author so we know who to blame.
